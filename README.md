<h1 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: middle;"> Code Prettifier Chrome Extension </h1>

A sleek, dark-mode Chrome extension that lets you **prettify and format code** right from your browser popup using [Prettier v3.5.3](https://prettier.io/). Supports JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JSON — with a modern UI built for simplicity.

---

<h2>✨ Features</h2>

- ✅ Supports **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JSON**
- 🎨 Modern, clean **dark mode** with deep blue vibes (similar to GitHub's dark theme, now that I notice)
- ⚙️ Uses **Prettier v3.5.3** under the hood (fully offline)
- 🧠 Easy-to-use dropdown & real-time formatting
- 📦 No external internet requests — secure & local

<h2>🚀 How to Install</h2>

1. **Clone or download this repo, then...**
   - Click the green `Code` button → `Download ZIP`
   - Or clone via terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/1OTH3R/code-prettifier-extension.git
     ```
   - Make sure to extract it anywhere on your device that you know you can keep it safe.

2. **Go to** `chrome://extensions` in your browser

3. Toggle **Developer mode** (top-right)

4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder you just downloaded

5. You’ll now see the Code Prettifier icon in your toolbar 💫

---

<h2>🛠️ How to Use</h2>

1. Click the extension icon
2. Choose your **code type** (JavaScript, HTML, etc.)
3. Paste your messy code into the first box
4. Hit the **“Prettify”** button
5. Copy the clean, formatted result from the output area

One important thing to know is that this will not accept dysfunctional code.

This is a code prettifier, not a code fixer/debugger. Also, please close your tags.
